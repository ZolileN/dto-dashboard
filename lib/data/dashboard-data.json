In addition, we have no data for the months of May, June and July 2016 because no users provided feedback. We are determining the best way to encourage more feedback from our users.",

This figure is then divided by the number of sessions as recorded by Google Analytics for dashboard.gov.au. The result is an average cost per transaction for the reporting period.
